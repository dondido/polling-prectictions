		SERVICE PROVIDED

		Polling predictions provides the capability of creation and/or use of interactive polls, created and maintained by its customers, to the user, who is at least eighteen (18) years old, or is a minor over the age of thirteen (13) who has parental permission. Service is provided "as is." There may, among other things, be unexpected downtimes, loss of data, delays or interruptions of service. POLLING PREDICTIONS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DATA LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF BUSINESS. 

		When you create a poll, Polling predictions may provide an HTML and/or Javascript code for you to include on your website (or any other page where you include such code, hereafter referred to as "Your website") to use certain features that we provide. Polling predictions cannot guarantee that such code will not interfere with other elements of Your website or that such coding will at all times work as described. You may not modify provided codes in any manner, except for changing the color and font to match your website. 

		Polling predictions is not obligated to monitor the Service, but may do so and may remove or edit any poll or message created through our site, or adjust your access to the Service. Polls or messages that Polling predictions may, in its sole discretion, elect to remove or edit include without limitation those which violate the "Restrictions" enumerated herein. 

		Polls and their results are provided for entertainment only, and are subject to error and innaccuracies. Although polls are intended to allow and limit a unique user to one vote for the period of time specified when it was created, such an outcome cannot be guaranteed. Poll results may be skewed for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the group of users targeted, or the distribution of your poll to groups of users with a particular interest. Under no circumstances shall polls and their results be relied upon for any decision of monetary or other value, including, but not limited to, determining the winner of a contest. 

		Any URLs that may be assigned to the polls that you create belong to Polling predictions and not to you, and are subject to removal at Polling predictions's discretion. 

		Polling predictions will place advertisements on polls, in exchange for the service provided. It is Polling predictions's sole discretion as to how many advertisements appear, and the form of these advertisements.
